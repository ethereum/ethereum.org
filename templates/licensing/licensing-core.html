            <h1>The core</h1>
            <p>
              The core of Ethereum includes the consensus engine, the networking code and any supporting libraries. For C++, this includes libethereum, libp2p, libdevcore, libdevcrypto, libethcore, libevm and libevmface.
            </p>
            <p>
              The core of Ethereum will be released under the most liberal of licences. This reflects our desire to have Ethereum used in as many diverse environments as possible, even those which, for various reasons can require modifications or augmentations to the software which cannot be released to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this way, while we have not arrived at a final licence, we expect to select one of the MIT licence, the MPL licence or the LGPL licence. If the latter is chosen, it will come with an amendment allowing it to be statically linked to software for which source code is not available.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this way, the core of Ethereum, be it C++ or Go, will be available for use in any commercial environment, closed or open source.

            <h1>The applications</h1>
            <p>
              The applications of Ethereum, including the Solidity compiler (libsolidity, solc), AlethZero and Mix will be distributed under the GNU General Public Licence. This is to reflect the fact that these pieces of software tend to not, by nature, need to be amalgamated or augmented into a larger, closed-source, whole. There is however, much to be gained through many different members of the Ethereum-community being incentivised to develop on and build out such software.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this way we hope our initial version of Solidity and Mix lay down the foundation for others to build upon and improve in the true Free/open-source software manner.
